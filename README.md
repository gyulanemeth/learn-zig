# learn-zig

Today, I tried to use capi ui on my raspberry pi os. Needed to install libgtk-3-dev, but even after that, I get a lot of errors. I assume it won't yet work with an arm processor.

I also tried ziggtk. That only works with zig 0.10.1, so I downloaded that. But unfortunately, I still got compile errors :(
